# Level-Design-Assignment

This repository contains the sketch and screenshots of a basic level for a first person shooter game.
The concept is of a smaller scale level with influences from halo, doom, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2 among others.
The level was designed using Unity, Probuilder and Progrids.
